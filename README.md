## Introduction

Energy demand forecasting plays a crucial role in the efficient management and planning of power grids. This project focuses on analyzing historical power consumption data in Delhi, alongside other influencing factors such as weather conditions and holidays, to create a predictive model for peak power demand.

### Key Objectives:
- Explore the factors that affect peak power consumption in Delhi.
- Develop a machine learning model to predict future peak demand based on historical data.
- Provide insights and visualizations to support better energy management.

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes detailed records of Delhi's peak power demand, combined with:
- **Weather data** (temperature, humidity, etc.)
- **Holiday information** and other factors affecting power consumption.

You can find the dataset [here](link to dataset).

---

## Data Analysis

The **Data Analysis** notebook provides a deep dive into the dataset. Key tasks performed include:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the patterns in peak power demand and identifying key relationships between power demand and factors like weather and holidays.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive graphs and charts to illustrate key insights from the data.

The notebook contains detailed explanations of each step in the code as well as a report summarizing the findings. The results of this analysis guide the feature selection for the predictive model.

## Prediction Model

The **Prediction Model** notebook uses machine learning techniques to forecast Delhi's future peak power demand based on the analysis. The steps include:
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features based on insights from the analysis to improve model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Several models are tested, and the best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics like RMSE and MAE.
- **Prediction Results**: Visualization of predicted vs actual peak power demand to assess model accuracy.

This notebook also includes a detailed report explaining the code and discussing the findings and model performance.
